# Customer-segmentation-cohort-analysis
Project Overview :-

Designed and developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze customer behavior, retention patterns, and spending insights for an e-commerce business. The project provided stakeholders with a 360Â° customer analytics view, combining KPIs, cohort analysis, and advanced visualizations to track churn, acquisition, and lifetime value across different segments.

Key Contributions & Insights :- 

Customer Retention & Cohort Analysis: Built a cohort heatmap and line charts to analyze retention rates and customer activity over time. Identified seasonal spikes in customer sign-ups and long-term retention gaps across cohorts.

Segmentation & Behavior Analysis: Designed a stacked bar chart to classify customers into segments. Highlighted how High Spenders & Loyal customers contributed the maximum revenue, while One-time buyers showed higher churn.

Spending & Lifetime Value Insights: Used a box & whisker plot to visualize customer lifetime value distribution across cohorts. Pinpointed outlier customers who contributed disproportionately to total revenue.

Transaction & Payment Trends: Implemented a waterfall chart to break down spending across payment methods (Credit Card, Debit Card, Net Banking, UPI). Showed that Debit Card and UPI were the highest contributors in terms of transaction value.

Filters & Interactivity: Incorporated slicers for Income Level, Acquisition Channel, and Customer Segment. Allowed stakeholders to drill down into customer behavior across demographics, acquisition channels, and spending levels.
